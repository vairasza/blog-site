So, hello everyone! Whoever is reading this blog. This is the first time I am publishing a blog post ever. Please do not run away right away, I think i need some time to get the drive.

Let me first introduce myself a little bit: My name is Michael, i am 30 years young and come from Bavaria. I started my journey in the field of informatics around 3 years ago, when i decided to start over and study  Media Informatics and Information Science at the University of Regensburg. Fast forward, i am currently working on my bachelor thesis, i applied for the master of science in Media Informatics (today) and study  for my AWS entry exam.

Why am i writing this blog? Easy! I just want to document what i learned on my path as a web developer. And maybe some else can benefit from one of my posts...
